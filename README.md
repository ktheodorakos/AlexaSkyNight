# AlexaSkyNight
A likelihood estimator, to help you plan for an ideal amateur astro-photography night star-gazing.

Living in a highly light-polluted city environment, especially in the highly-humid & cloudy Belgium, makes planning astrophotography/stargazing nights an unpleasant chore. The purpose of this project is to generate a "star-gazing" quality index for a specific night/hour time-span. This indicator can be generated using various existing weather & light
pollution data provision services.

So the idea is to just ask Alexa:

Is it ok to stargaze tonight?
Which constellations can I watch?
Which stellar objects can I photograph this night?
